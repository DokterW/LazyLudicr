# LazyLudicr

MacOS has its Disk Utility to easily create encrypted disk images. Linux has ... VeraCrypt. An amazing tool but similar to PGP/GPG and email, very inefficient to use.

This is where LazyLudicr (Lazy LUKS Disk Image Creator) comes in. A simple bash script to create encrypted disk images using [LUKS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_Unified_Key_Setup).

Thanks for the inspiration [FSM](http://freesoftwaremagazine.com/articles/create_encrypted_disk_image_gnulinux/).
